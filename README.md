# Hints to Recognize Solution

- If the problem involves finding the next greater element in an array or sequence, consider using a stack. 
- Utilize a stack to keep track of indices rather than values when you need to find the difference in positions.
- If you need to handle elements in a "last in, first out" manner, especially in comparison problems, a stack may be a good choice.
- If the problem involves the ordering of elements and you need to maintain that order, consider sorting.
- For problems where you need to consider elements in a "last in, first out" manner or you want to keep track of the previous element, a stack might be useful.
- When you need to compare sequential elements and merge them based on certain conditions, think of a stack to maintain the state.
- If the problem involves finding the largest contiguous subarray or sequence, consider using a stack.
- Use a stack to keep track of indices rather than values when you need to find the boundaries of the subarray or sequence.
- A stack is helpful in problems where you need to find the nearest element satisfying a certain condition, either on the left or the right.
